Los Angeles, California ðŸ˜Ž. The City of Angels. Tinseltown. The Entertainment Capital of the World! 

Known for its warm weather, palm trees, sprawling coastline, and Hollywood, along with producing some of the most iconic films and songs. However, as with any highly populated city, it isn't always glamorous and there can be a large volume of crime. That's where you can help!

You have been asked to support the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) by analyzing crime data to identify patterns in criminal behavior. They plan to use your insights to allocate resources effectively to tackle various crimes in different areas.

## The Data

They have provided you with a single dataset to use. A summary and preview are provided below.

It is a modified version of the original data, which is publicly available from Los Angeles Open Data.
